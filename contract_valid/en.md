# EOSpark.com launches EOS contract source code verification

## background
Recently, FOMO3D is very popular. Some teams have transplanted this Ethereum game to EOS. However, the game has recently exploded and has been used by individual players to obtain more than 6w EOS by overflow attack. See here for details.

The reason we participate in blockchain games is because in the world of blockchains, code is rules, laws, and constraints. Planning, law, and restraint should be visible to everyone, and everyone can know. That is, the source code of the smart contract should be made public. In the previous EOS game, the user lost more than 6w EOS. The important reason is that the player cannot view the source code of the game and cannot check whether there is a malicious vulnerability in the game.

Therefore, EOSPark first launched the EOS contract source code verification function. This feature includes:
1. The user can view the source code of a contract
2. The project party can upload the source code for online verification.
3. Contract abnormality notification

## User view contract source code
At present, many project parties have published the source code of their smart contracts.

#### Contract：eosiomeetone
Contract address：<https://eospark.com/MainNet/contract/eosiomeetone>

#### Contract：gameworldcom
Contract address：<https://eospark.com/MainNet/contract/gameworldcom>

## Upload source code
If a smart contract does not disclose its source code, the user can ask the project party to upload the source code to EOSpark. If the project party refuses to upload, the contract should be used with caution. If the project party uploads the wrong source code, it will not be verified by EOSpark.

## Contract abnormality notification

Since the EOS smart contract can be redeployed, if the project party uploads the source code and re-deploys the contract after verification, this means that there may be risks associated with using the contract. For such cases, EOSpark will give an exception reminder, and the project party can re-upload the corresponding source code.

The trust of the blockchain world is based on openness and transparency, and the security of the contract is related to the security of the user's assets. Therefore, the disclosure of the contract source code is the responsibility of the project party and the responsibility of the user. EOSpark introduces contract code verification to help the project side provide users with a safe and reliable blockchain application world, and to protect the security of user assets.
